            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>OVERAIGNE, Knowing well that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemes à Bishop to ſpeak in the behalfe of the Church and his King and ſeeing that the writinge of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Charenton made bold to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe it ſelfe vnto your Maieſty both againſt the Catholike Church and by conſequence, againſt your Maieſty ſince that beeing her eldeſt ſonne, her intereſts are yours, I iudged it to be my duty not to remayne ſilent, eſpecially amongſt ſuch as triumphed, vpon this occaſion, as though forſooth, they had borne away ſome glorious victorie ouer the Faith of our Anceſters.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:21747:3"/>
            <p>This was that <hi>(Soueraigne)</hi> which inuited me to imploy my vacant tyme, to make the Church her innocencie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as glorious in your Maieſties ſight, as she hath bene repreſented vnto you blame-worthy: and the Belief of her Accuſers as pernicious, as they ſtriue to haue it eſteemed holy.</p>
            <p>In the performance hereof I will vſe the greatest moderation that I can poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; deſiring, that as our Beleife, and theirs with whom I am to deale, are contrarie, ſo may alſo our manner of proceeding be. And in lieu of the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by which they impoſe vpon vs ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie calumnies, we may render to them truth accompaigned with ſuch ſweetnes that if they diſpenſe with their paſſions, they may receaue occaſion of content.</p>
            <p>Thence they shalt knowe that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne is, to doe them good, not euill: to cure, not to wound them: and that we are ſo
<pb facs="tcp:21747:3"/>farre from hating them as they pretend, that wee doe vnfeynedly loue them, and in ſuch à meaſure, as that we hate not their Doctrine but by reaſon of the loue which we beare vnto their perſons: being à thinge impoſsible, that à man should not haue in horrour, the kinfe that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his friend, and the poiſon which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeues him of life.</p>
            <p>We loue them <hi>(Soueraigne)</hi> in ſo full à meaſure of Charitie, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteede of wishing their hurt, as they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceaue, we moſt humbly petition to your Maieſtie to inrich them with your Royall fauour, by endeuouring ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciously to roote vp the errours which haue taken deepe roote in their harts, and to procure their conuerſion. And that they may not conceaue that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of their Good, it is their hurt that I ayme at; and, that ſpeaking of their conuerſion, I would incite your
<pb facs="tcp:21747:4"/>Maieſtie to force them vnto it; I will aſſure your ſaid Maieſtie, that the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wayes are thoſe, which I apprehend moſt conuenient to reclame chriſtian ſoules from errour: Experience rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs, that offentymes, violent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſerue onely the more to exaſperate the maladies of the mynde. By this meanes your Maieſtie corresponding to the glorious title of MOST CHRISTIAN, purchaſed by the pietie of your Predeceſſours, shall publish your ſelfe the moſt famous king in the world, and shall more and more eſtablish à conſtant peace and repoſe in your dominions. It being indoubtedly true, that it is à thing incomparably greater to gaine ſoules, then to conquere Kingdomes: And by how much more your ſubiects shall be vnited to God, by ſo much shall they be more ſurely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb facs="tcp:21747:4"/>to your Maieſties ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Now wheras, in the deſeaſes which doe affect the parts noble, remedies are to be applied which are proper vnto them; obſeruing, that beſides that hereſie is as poyſon which of its owne nature tends to the ſeaſure of the hart, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, haue particularly addreſſed their writing to your Maieſtie which is the hart that doth quicken this flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Realme, though I know, yea it is à thing knowen to the whole world, that the ſoliditie of your faith preſerues it from all perill, yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued that my dutie did engage me, to preſent vnto him the Antidote which I hope will be ſo much more agreeable vnto him, as my deſigne, is to teſtifie vnto him by this action, that all the endeuours of my life, shall neuer haue other ayme then

            <p>My purpoſe is to diſcouer.</p>
            <p>That the Miniſters of Charenton. are ill grounded in all their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>That they haue all the reaſon in the world to commend our Kings, and no occaſion at all to complayne ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as they doe.</p>
            <p>That their Beleife is not hared for the reaſons they alleadge, though worthy of hatred, for many others,
<pb facs="tcp:21747:6"/>which cuningly they conceale.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, that the Catholike Church, her Miniſters, and all thoſe whom they accuſe, remayne free from the crimes which they impoſe vpon them.</p>
            <p>To effect this, I haue diuided this booke into 19. chap. in the firſt 14. I ſatisfie the Miniſters writing from point to point. The other fiue are ſpent in deducing the reaſons for which their doctrine ought to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of all the world.</p>
            <p>The Reader may pleaſe to know, that ſtudying breuitie in this my anſwere, I haue no intent, to heape together all that might be ſaid vpon euery point, and yet ſay enough too to make it impoſſible for our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, to shake or moue what I shal eſtablish.</p>
            <p>Further let him know, that as often
<pb facs="tcp:21747:7"/>as I can poſſibly, I make vſe of their confeſſion of Faith with whom I deale, and of the teſtimonie of their owne Authours, ſo that, without blushing and Lying both at once, they shall not be able to call in queſtion the truth which I publish.</p>
            <p>I had tyed my ſelfe to the onely confeſſion of their Faith, if I had found it as compleate and intire as full of defectes. But wheras they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne not halfe the points which are in controuerſie betwixt vs and thoſe too which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayne being expreſſed in an obſcure, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued manner, I was forced to haue recourſe to their Authours; to Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin and Luther amongſt the reſt, whoſe authoritie they cannot reiect. Not Caluins, becauſe they make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues his followers in à peculiar manner; gathering out of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
<pb facs="tcp:21747:7"/>their confeſſion, their Church-prayers, their Catechiſme, and the forme of adminiſtring, their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

            <p>I beſeech the Miniſters that if they anſwere me, they doe it inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously, and giue ſatisfaction to each point of this booke, ſo that I may take as confeſſed all which they doe not conteſt. I coniure, them that in their anſwere, they doe ether ingenuously confeſſe what we hold, or at leaſt, that they make their owne defence without ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitie in words. If they giue vs clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vnderſtand what their beleife
<pb facs="tcp:21747:8"/>is, we shall be greatly obliged vnto them, ſince we haue ordinarily more difficultie to fish it out then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it:<note place="margin">Hieron. ad Cte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiph. cont.

            </p>
            <p>To conclude, the Miniſters may pleaſe not to eſteeme they haue anſwered ſufficiently, if, when I haue alleadged à paſſage of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours for à thing, they produce another of them who affirmes the contrarie; becauſe they cannot thence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that they taught not that which I pretend, but onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that it is the cuſtomarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of Heretikes to contradict one another.</p>

It apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes not-vnto you, as it doth deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that of all Chriſtian ſocieties, which contaynes the greateſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as I haue alreadie shewen.

                     <p>And in verie deede reaſon doth teach vs, that diuers thinges ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate one to another, doe no wayes deſtroy their vnitie. Vvhich is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in this, that the inſtrument is not tearmed another cauſe then the principall cauſe, in vertue wherof it workes. The Maſon and his hammar are not two cauſes of the houſe, but one onely. The man and the ſword
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21747:41"/>which kills, are but one onely cauſe of death: whence it is manifeſt, that wheras S. Peter, doth onely partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of Heade by reaſon of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and reference he hath to Ieſus Chriſt, it doth not any way hinder Ieſus Chriſt to remayne the onely head of the Church; like as the power of Gouernour in a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, doth not conſtitute two Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, the Lieutenant participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely of that power of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by ſubordination to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Nor is it to the purpoſe to ſay, that a Lieutenant doth not inferre two Gouernours, becauſe he beares not the name of Gouernour, ſince it is not the name that makes the thing: and againe to find a true ſimilitude in the things we ſpeake of, it is onely requiſite, that like as the power of a Lieutenant is ſubordinate to that of the Gouernour, ſo the power which S. Peter inioyes in the Church, may be ſubiect and ſubordinate to Chriſts power in the ſame Church. That the Lieutenant is not inſtiled Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, cauſeth no chang at all in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21747:42"/>nature of the thing, but doth onely shew an accidentall difference, to witt, that the Lieutenant and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour doe often chance to meet together, in the ſame towne or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince wherof they haue the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: wheras Ieſus Chriſt in his owne ſpecies doth neuer meet with his Lieutenant in the viſible gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church. And hence it is, that though we doe not aſſcribe the name of Gouernour to his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to the end we might auoyd confuſion (otherwiſe being both together how should the one be diſcerned from the other) yet doe we iuſtly attribute the title of <hi>head</hi> to the Pope, where the ſaid inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience can haue no place.</p>
                     <p>Yea Caluine himſelfe vpon that paſſage of S. Mathew, Nolite &amp;c. be not called Rabbis For one is your maſter Chriſt. <hi>Let no man ſaith he, ſticke or trouble himſelfe about wordes. Chriſt cares not how they be intituled who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the inſtruction of others.</hi> So <hi>there is one onely Paſtour, and yet he admitts many Paſtours vnder himſelfe, ſo that he may
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21747:42"/>haue preeminencie aboue them all and by them he alone may gouerne the Church.</hi> And a litle after. <hi>The true ſenſe is, That then the paternall honour is falſely attributed vnto men, when it obſcures Gods glorie: which happens as often as a mortall man independently of God, is eſteemed father.</hi> And in another place, hauing obiected vnto himſelfe, that the ſcripture commands that God onely be called Father, he ſaith, <hi>I Anſvvere, that Paule doth in ſuch ſort take the name of Father, that he doth not abragate, or diminish the leaſt particule of Gods glorie. It is a common prouerbe, that what is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate doth not repugne. Such is the name of Father in Paule being compared to God. God alone is the Father of all the faithfull yet he admitts the Miniſters, Whom he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes therin, to the participation of his ovvne honour, Without derogating from the ſame. God therfore was the ſpirituall father of Tymothie, and that his onely father too, properly ſpeaking, but Paule, Who was Gods miniſter in begetting Tymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, doth by a certaine right of ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion chalence to himſelfe the title.</hi> And againe: <hi>It is an ordinarie thing that as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21747:43"/>far forth as God doth exerciſe his povver in creatures, ſo far doth he tranſcribe his ovvne names vnto them. So he is our onely Lord and Father, and yet fathers and Lords are they too, Whom he daignes with this honour, Whence it is, that as well Angells as Iudges are called Gods.</hi> You heare how Chriſt cares not by what name they be called, who vndertake to preach and teach: That he is ſo the ſole Paſtour, that he admitts ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnder him: That to call a man Father doth not obſcure the glorie of God. Vnleſſe he be ſo called inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of God. That things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate doe not repugne. That by the right of ſubordination S. Paule did chalence vnto himſelfe the name of Father. That the name of God, is cuſtomarily aſcribed vnto creatures, ſo far forth as by them he doth exerciſe his power.

                     <p>Againe why should it more repugne, that another man should be called head of the Church together with Ieſus Chriſt in the law of grace, then in the old law: in which, though Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was the head of the Church, yet was the High prieſt alſo called by that name, as the holy ſcripture doth remarke, and<note n="a" place="margin">Calu. <hi>4.</hi> inſl. cap. <hi>6.</hi> Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburg. cent. <hi>1.</hi> l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>17.</hi>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21747:46"/>onely moment: But the Pope is ſo head of the ſame, that without him it could for a tyme ſubſiſte. Moreouer, the Church is the body of Chriſt, not of the Pope. For Chriſt being as it were the Hypoſtaſis and baſis of this body, he ſupports all the members therof, and workes all in all. He ſees by the eyes, heares by the eares, teacheth by his Doctours, baptiſeth by his Miniſters; by all he doth all. which doth not ſuite with the Pope. Noe man now, in my iudgement can apprehend S. Peters authoritie in the Church to be preiudiciall to that of Ieſus Chriſt, ſince it is wholy of another nature and rancke then his, and his withall, inferiour and ſubiect to it. Nor can the name of head, any more preiudice Chriſt, ſince names doe add nothing to the nature of things, nether doe they ſignifie the ſame nature, or equall power with the diuers ſubiects to which they are attributed, ſith euen the leaſt ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and conformitie, is ſufficient, to allote the ſame names to ſubiects of ſundrie natures. Finally, if Chriſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21747:46"/>be iniured, for that, he being the head of the vniuerſall Church, yet the name and nature of Heade is conferred vpon S. Peter, his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Vicaire generall ouer the whole Church; why is there not alſo iniurie done vnto God, he being as well the head of euerie particular Church, when the ſame honour is done to his Lieutenants therin? Or if, as well in the one caſe as the other, his honour be diminished, why doe you, in conſeruing him from one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, permit another to come vpon him?

If you grant this, why should a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie which is not iniurious in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, be iniurious in the perſon of Peter? But if you deney it render a reaſon of your negation. It is not, in that the eſſence or nature of Head, is, in <hi>genere,</hi> or generally ſpeaking, contumelious, ſince you grant it to a prince whom you honour: Nor is it, for that one onely is not ſufficient to gouerne the vniuerſall Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe following that ſuppoſition the Church is reduced to ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that it doth not exceede the abilitie of one man to gouerne it ſince one man actually in that exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth gouerne it. And therefore it is manifeſt, that that which we teach is not iniurious to Ieſus Chriſt:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21747:48"/>or if it be, impertinently then doe you ſuſtayne the part of a Plaintiue in a crime, wherin you your ſelues will be conuinced as culpable. Vvhich yet will be made more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by the inſuing articles, where I will endeuour to shew that it is a greater aduantage of honour, to produce a thing by the aſſiſtance of another (though one man alone be able to produce it) permitting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue share in the glorie, which he could reſerue to himſelfe alone, and will make appeare by conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that it is more honorable to Chriſt Ieſus, who alone is able to gouerne the Church yea thirtie Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, if ſo many there could be, to let others share in this gouernement, then wholy to reſerue it to himſelfe. And euen at this preſent I will giue you a ſcantling of it, in that which by the light of faith you haue ſeene, to witt, that God did repute it a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter laude and glorie, to haue conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Chriſt, as man, the Heade of the vniuerſall Church vnder him, then to haue retayned, and reſerued

                     <p>In concluſion I would in treate the Reader, diligently to obſerue the Miniſters ſubtiltie, which is of this nature; that wheras there are two ſorts of queſtions. The one. Vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope be the Heade of the vniuerſall Church. The other whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſing him to be the head of the vniuerſall Church, he ought to be called another head of the Church then Ieſus Chriſt, or not. In like manner: whether good workes be meritorious, and ſuppoſing them to be meritorious whether that merit ought to be tearmed another merit then that of Ieſus Chriſt? Vvhether the workes of pennane doe cleance from ſinne; and ſuppoſing they doe cleance from ſinne whether they ought to be called another cleance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or purgatorie then the blood of Ieſus Chriſt? whether the rite and celebration of the Euchariſt be a true ſacryfice; and ſuppoſing it to be a true ſacryfice, whether it is to be called another ſacryfice then that of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21747:49"/>the Croſſe? Of which two queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the firſt belonges to the nature and beeing of the thing and is of Faith. The ſecond, reſpects the name onely, and is not of Faith,<note place="margin">S. Aug. contr. Iulianum cap. c.</note> and therfore, as S. Auguſtine ſaith, may be diſputed pro &amp;con amongſt Catholikes Doctours, without impeachment to Faith.</p>
                     <p>In theſe queſtions, this is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters craft. They paſſe the firſt which is of faith ouerin ſilence; The other, which is not of Faith, they diſcuſſe. To the end that by reiecting theſe formes of ſpeach. <hi>There is another head of the Church then Chriſt: another merit, then Chriſts merit: another ſacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, then the ſacryfice of the Croſſe &amp;c.</hi> they may carrie away the Reader to beleeue, that none is head of the Church but Chriſt: and finally that no action but that which Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vpon the Croſſe was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
                     <p>And be it that following ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Doctours we may vſe thoſe kindes of ſpeach, ether meaning, that there is another head of the Church then Ieſus Chriſt, another

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21747:50"/>Chriſt, but by the power and vertue therof, and that in a far different manner, to witt, inferiour and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to that, by which he doth firſt purge vs, one ought not to call it another purgatorie: becauſe diuers Purgatories, for the reaſons alreadie alleaged, import a purifying (diuerſi generis) of another kind, while yet, no ſuch thing is found in mans iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, there being nothing at all which can purge vs, but by the force and efficacie of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt. This blood it ſelfe, of it ſelfe doth expiate our crymes, as being the onely and proper priſe of our ſinnes, and that wherby our debts are cancelled. But the word of God, Penance, Faith, Charitie, and ſuch like, doe not of themſelues expiate, but by the vertue which doth reſide in the blood of Chriſt, but by depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancie of that; but by power deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from it. They doe not purge as the priſe of our ſinnes, but as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and inſtruments, inſtituted to the end the efficacie of the blood of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt might be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21747:51"/>applyed vnto vs which doth plainly shew that all theſe purging prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, though they be of another or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or degree, yet are they of the ſame kind, and by conſequence, that there is but one purgatorie.</p>
                     <p>Both you and we doe ioyntly hold, that ſinnes are forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſole and onely mercy of God; yet dare none deney but the ſame ſinnes are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, which is the fruite and effect of this diuine mercy, and the glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument by which it is applyed vnto vs: ſo In like manner, when we ſay that ſinns are forgiuen by the blood of Chriſt, there is no repugnance, to ſay alſo that they are remitted by faith, and the Sacraments which are the wholſome and bleſſed effects of this blood, and inſtruments appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to applie it vnto our wounds. Vvherin if we iniure God, how will you purge your ſelues of the ſame crime? for as we ſuſtayne that ſinnes are cleanced by Sacraments which applie vnto vs the priſe of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours precious bloode; ſo likewiſe,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21747:51"/>you hold that by Faith ſinnes are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. Vvhence it is, that though we doe greatly differre in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the meanes, which by ſuch application, doe blot out ſinnes, yet we agree in the ſubſtance of the thing we here defend, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that we ioyntly confeſſe, that ſome things there are which doe cleance vs by the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the merits and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of our ſauiours bloode. Nor will it auayle you to ſay that you doe far differre from vs; for that we would haue faith to concurre to iuſtification, by way of a diſpoſition, wheras you hold that it concurrs no otherwiſe, then that as a hand recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues what is preſented, ſo faith doth apprehend or lay hand vpon iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which the blood of Chriſt did intirely produce, For this is ſaid onely, and hath no ſufficient ground.

                     <p>But verily ſo far is the doctrine of the Catholike Church, from drawing a coutumelie vpon the merit of the blood of Chriſt, that contrariwiſe, euen as he should be eſteemed iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to Gods mercy, who should ſay that our ſinnes are ſo abolished by the meanes therof, that they should not in any ſort ſtand in neede of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, which yet was diſpoſed by the ſame diuine mercy, as its inſtrument, ſo should one doe an iniurie to the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, to hold that our ſinnes are ſo cleanced by it, that Faith and Sacraments, which the ſonne of God inſtituted in his blood as fitt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to apply it vnto our ſoules, did not at all cleance them.

                     <p>THat we teach no other propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatorie ſacryfice then that of leſus Chriſt, the reaſon which aboue we deduced at large, doth make good; the word, <hi>other,</hi> ſignfying a thing of a diuers kind, when it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken abſolutly, as the Miniſters in this place doe take it.

And like as he who hath an excellent fruite tree, shewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe far more liberall, if making a preſent of his ripe fruite, he adde alſo a young shoot therof which of it ſelfe may yeeld fruite: ſo Ieſus Chriſt, is much more bountifull, in beſtowing vpon men not onely the fruite of his propitiation which ſprung from his owne perſon in the ſacryfice of the Croſſe, but euen another ſacryfice which as an excellent shoote, is able to bring forth fruites like to thoſe which we gathered vpon the tree of the Croſſe. Vvher fore, ſo farr is the propitiation of the ſacryfice of the Euchariſt, from preiudicing the propitiation of the ſacryfice of the Croſſe, that on the contrarie ſide it
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21747:56"/>makes the perfection and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce therof more gloriouſly appeare.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21747:61"/>to his grace; our prayers and impetrations to his. Wherupon he deneys that the iuſtice of workes is oppoſite to the iuſtice of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that, is ſubiect to this. In the ſame place, and for the ſame reaſon, he ſuſtaynes that the hope of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is conceaued by good workes, is not contradictorie to the hope of ſaluation, which we demand through the mercy of God. But hence it is yet more manifeſt, that, as the merit of Chriſt, doth not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the glorie of Gods mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, (for that argues no impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie in his mercy, as though of it ſelfe it were not powerfull enough, to reſtore vs what we haue loſt) but contrariwiſe Chriſts merit, doth commend and extolle the force of the dinine mercy, when it makes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that the diuine mercy was not content, to haue brought vs againe in to grace and fauour with God, but moreouer, it would haue Chriſt to merit this grace for vs, which did farſurpaſſe that. For none can doubt but one that should haue
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21747:61"/>loſt all his fortunes, should be far more obliged to him who would redeeme them, to the end to render them vnto him; then to him, who would otherwiſe render them, not taking the paines to redeeme them. Vvherfore the merits of men doe not leſſen the merits of Chriſt; nor argue taem of inſufficiencie or impotencie, as not being powerfull enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore vnto vs what we had loſt: for it is a cleare thing, that wheras they are of an infinite value, euen euery leaſt part therof, could haue merited all. But contrariwiſe mens merits doe openly proclame the vertue of Chriſt his merits: fos, as the mercy of God, did bountefully beſtow vpon vs the merits of Chriſt; ſo Chriſts merits doe impart vnto vs, ours; and make a more ample demonſtration of his goodnes and glorie, in that he would not onely merit that for our benefit, which we of our ſelues were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to merit, to wit, remiſſion of the fault, and ſatisfaction for the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall paine, but moreouer he would haue vs to merit thoſe things (as the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21747:62"/>increaſe of grace) together with him, which doe not exceede the capacitie of our merits. Vvhich is ſo far from depreſſing, that it doth euen extolle his glorie, ſince that there is nothing more glorious, then to admitt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, freely and of our owne accord, into the participation of that glorie, which we could haue reſerued to our ſelues alone. Thus doth Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede with vs as well in this as in that which he doth impetrate for vs: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not onely merit that alone wherof we were incapable, as the firſt inſpirations to good; but he would alſo merit ſtrength for vs, to demand and obtayne ſome thinges with him: which is a far greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: for in that, he doth not onely impart vnto vs the fruit of his prayers but alſo beſtowes vpon vs the vertue therof; that is, he did not onely make vs capable of receauing what he produced, but alſo granted vnto vs power with him, to produce, and withall to receaue ſome thing. The ſame happens in the production of naturall things, wher God, who of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21747:62"/>himſelfe is able to produce all things, doth yet practiſe that abſolute power, in the production of thoſe things, which are beyond the reach, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cauſes, as for example, the creation of the world, of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, of reaſonable ſoules, and leaue them to contribute their vertue to all other things that are not placed without their ſpheere, to manifeſt therby the exceſſe of his bountie, and to acquire vnto himſelfe a larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of honour, by making them not onely partakers of the effects which flow from his power, but of force withall to produce them with him: being a more honorable thing vnto God to endow ſecond cauſes with force to cooperate in ſome things with him, then to leaue them without all action in his productions, as though they were altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the ſame. Howbeit the (ratio) or eſſence of merit which is found in the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of men, proceeds not from the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their worke, but from the grace alone which they receaue by the metit of Ieſus Chriſt,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21747:63"/>as S. Auguſtin obſerues, ſaying, that <hi>the merits of the iuſt are merits, becauſe they are iuſt,</hi> that is, for that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s iuſtified, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto God, by meanes of his grace which is in them, who will thinke that our merits which are the effectes of the grace of Chriſt alone, doe diſparage the glorie of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt? yea who will not planely diſcouer, that the merits of men doe redound to the glorie of Chriſt his merits? No otherwiſe then the ſplendour of rich gemmes, and the brightnes of the moone and ſtarrs, which are effectes of the ſunn's Light, doe augment his glorie, ſo far are they from diminishing it! Vvhich moued Brentius to ſay,<note place="margin">In Apologia, Confeſſ.

                     <p>Vvhence it is manifeſt, that our merits are ſo far from iniuring tho
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21747:63"/>merits of Chriſt, that they euen turne to his greater glorie. And indeede, ſince the operations of the members belong to the head, becauſe this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them, and imparts vertue towards their productio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how should the dignitie of the workes of the members of Ieſus Chriſt our Heade, become rather contumelious then honorable vnto him? <hi>By euery one of our actions,</hi> ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">In cap <hi>6.</hi> Zachariae.

Ghoſt; the fruites of our ſauiours paſſion; the effectes of grace, in fine, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie of good workes which proceed rather from God then from men? Vvho will not in contemplation her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of iudge your religion worthy of hatred, yea euen of horrour; and ours for the contrarie, praiſe worthy? And therfore it is apparent that if your doctrine be hated in reſpect of that which it teacheth touching me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, you cannot, as you pretend, draw any aduantage from it, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe it turnes to your diſaduantage, ſince it is hated, not for ſuſtayning a thing which is aduantagious, but preiudiciall to Gods glorie. Vvhich happens not onely in this point, but in all the reſt of the points of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>It is truly hated for ſuſtayning things preiudiciall to God, not onely in that you deney, as I haue alreadie shewen, the workes of Saints to be meritoriours; but, which is more

And this may be more iuſtly auerred of yours, then of any other; becauſe in certaine paſſages you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſenſe which Luther recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Diuell in a viſible shape. You delude the people by perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that of all the exteriour meanes vſefull for our ſaluation, the reading of the Bible is the onely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine one: which is manifeſtly falſe, for otherwiſe the blind which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reade; ſimple and ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t people who haue no learning, could not be amongſt the number of the faithfull.

They againe, who vnderſtand not the hebrew and greeke tongue were not capable of faith, ſince, according to you, no verſion is authenticall, nor can faith be attayned vnto but by a meanes which is infallible. But if you reply that ſuch people may receaue it from the mouth of their Paſtours who doe faithfully preach vnto them the word of God: it followes then that the Scripture is not the onely externe meanes to obtayne Faith, ſince you your ſelues adioyne this ſecond, which cannot be ſufficient for ſome, vnleſſe it were ſo for all the reſt. And in deede what reaſon is there ſo to ty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayne the word of God to paper, to the character and letter, that it can no further be a meanes of ſaluation, then it is contayned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <p>Secondly, becauſe if this meanes be ſufficient for all the world, the Fathers of the Church, the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Anabaptiſts, and others, who with great care and diligence made vſe of it, erred not in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points of faith as in your writings you vpbrade them.

If you find this ſuppoſition in ſcripture; we are in the wrong; if not; you are ill grounded in your faith: for it is euident that this Principle, to witt, that <hi>it is ſufficient to make a propoſition to be an Article of faith, that it be inferred out of ſeripture,</hi> is purely humaine, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> diuine.</p>
                     <p>Further, put caſe it weretrue, and made good by ſcripture, that an inference were a valide fundation of faith, yet according to your ſelues, this would onely haue place in conſequences dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen out of two diuine Principles which are both contayned in the ſcripture; ſeeing it is euident, that one of them being humane, the certaintie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion cannot be diuine: ſeeing that euery concluſion is of the ſame nature with the more imperfect part of its cauſe; and that that wherby a thing is knowen, ought to be better knowen then the thing it ſelfe. So that if the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21747:83"/>Principle wherby a concluſion is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, be onely knowen by a humane knowledge, the concluſion cannot be knowen by a more perfect knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore albeit, that euen an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this nature and kind, might ſerue for a valide fundation of our faith, yet were it nothing to your pourpoſe, ſince in the ſillogiſme by which you conclude the aſſurance of your ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen admitting of your owne ac count, there is but one of the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes diuine, contayned in the ſcripture, that <hi>who ſoeuer beleeues is iuſtified,</hi> the other which affirmes <hi>that you beleeue,</hi> being meerly humane, as not being mentioned in all the ſcripture, nether in expreſſe termes, nor yet by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                     <p>I adde, that though it were granted, which yet is falſe, that a concluſion drawen out of two principles, the one diuine, the other humane, might be a ſufficient motiue to oblige vs to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue: yet should not that be but in regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de it were drawen by a companie of wiſe and learned men, no man being of ſo weake a diſcourſe, as to thinke a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21747:83"/>drawen by an ignorant perſon, or an Idiote who knowes not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes to a good inference; drawen, I ſay, from a Principle which he alone tinowes, is a ſufficient and valide funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon of diuine and infallible faith.</p>
                     <p>And yet in theſe termes are you. A poore plough man vpon his death-bed can not be ſure of his ſaluation, vnleſſe he inferre it by conſequence ont of a Principle knowen to himſelfe alone, ſith none but himſelfe knowes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he haue truly faith.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth it ſuffice to ſay that in this behalfe he is interiourly guided by the holy Ghoſt, who aſſures him of faith. Becauſe in that caſe, we were to admitt of another word of God not written; and giuen not to the Church, but onely to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular man, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by that meanes you make ſolewittnes and Iudg in his owne cauſe.

                     <p>Is it likely that God who made the ſcripture, to teach vs therby the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to become iuſt in his ſight would expreſſly haue put downe an hundred articles for example, the beliefe wherof iuſtifies vs not, (and which, according to you might be beleeued by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells, and by Hypocrites,) and yet would not expresly put downe that, by the beliefe her of walone you teach, that we are iuſtified, and that wherin you place the eſſence and fundation of your religion; and which is the crooke <hi>the</hi>

And therfore the certaintie of the concluſion which imports that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſaued, for two reaſons cannot be in fallible: both becauſe it depends of a <hi>medium</hi> which is humane, and fallible of its owne nature; and againe becauſe this medium depends vpon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an ignorant fellow.</p>
                     <p>Nay further, it followes by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that euery one beleeues by diuine faith that he is iuſte, before he knowes that God doth ſay ſo, which cannot poſſibly be Gods' word which is the onely obiect of Faith.</p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:21747:85"/>
                     <p>That this followes, I shew it. Peter, for example knowes not that God calls him iuſte, but onely by meanes of a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme drawen out of ſcripture; now the <hi>Minor,</hi> of this ſyllogiſme ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Peter both to repent and to haue ſaith, which faith conſiſtes in beleeuing that he is iuſtified by the apprehenſion of Chriſt his iuſtice; true therfore it is, that Peter beleeues that he is iuſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knowes that God ſaith so.</p>
                     <p>It is therfore manifeſt out of your owne principles, that your faith is not infallible but humaine, and vaine too. Nor haue you any thing by wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now all theſe conſiderations had no place in the ſatisfactions which were done vnto the Church, for thoſe were not inioyned for priuate ſinns, nor for ſinns of leſſe moment, nor yet were they done in priuate: nor, as you would haue it, to pacifie God by pennance, or to obtaine mercy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>True it is, happily you will ſay, that canonicall paynes were remitted by the Church, and ſome also there are which are ſatisfactorie; yet wheras they are not all of that kind, it followes not that they which were remitted by the Church, were of that kind. To this

Further, wher as reaſon will, that he that hath power to impoſe a paine, should haue also power to remitt the ſame, it planely followes that if the Church im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe paines, which are ſatisfactorie before God, it can also abſolue from them.

                  <p>The words doe planly shew, that the paines which were remitted in the primi tiue Church were due vnto God, not to men; and that indulgences of that nature were wont to be conferred without the Sacraments: becauſe, as we are to marke, they were done by vertue of the ſufferance of Martires, wheras Sacraments haue all their force from our ſauiours paſſion. Why doth Tertullian, (after he had ſpoken of the paines, which are remitted by Ieſus-Chriſt) exprobate the Church for aſſcribing the ſame power to her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires vnleſſe he did accnowledge the paines pardoned in fauour of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, to be the verie ſame with thoſe which Chriſt pardoned, to witt, thoſe which are ſatisfactorie in the ſight of God? Why did Theophilactus, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding thoſe words of S. Paule, who did vſe Indulgences towards the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous

                  <p>THe truth of the body of Ieſus-Chriſt being thus eſtablished, the truth of the ſacrifice, which you reiect, cannot be called in queſtion. For if Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus-Chriſt be truly preſent in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, as I haue ſufficiently though ſuccinctly proued, it followes, that he is truly ſacrificed, as preſently I will demonſtrate and you your ſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. <hi>Granting</hi> ſaith vrſimus, <hi>the opinion of the corporall preſence,</hi> the papiſticall adoration and oblation, with the romish maſſe, muſt also be granted.</p>
                  <p>Sacrifice is no other thing then a reall oblation, (offered to God alone) of a thing permanent and ſubiect to ſenſe, changed withall, and ordayned to teſtifie, and profeſſe, that we accnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his ſoueraigntie ouer vs.</p>
                  <p>But the celebration of the Euchariſt which Ieſus-Chriſt inſtituted vnder the shape and liknes of a thing without
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:21747:101"/>life, is ſuch an oblation.</p>
                  <p>Therfore ſuch an oblation is a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>Now that the oblation wherof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſpeake, is a thing permanent and ſubiect to ſenſe, is eaſily proued, ſince the body of our ſaniour is offered vnder a shape which is within the reach of ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>But if you contend that Chriſt is not viſible becauſe he cannot be ſeene, I reply with the Fathers,<note place="margin">Chryſostom. hom. <hi>84.</hi> in Matth. Ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum vides, ipſum tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, ipſum comedis. Et l. <hi>3.</hi> De Sacerdot. Qui cum Patre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum ſedet in ipſo temporis momento manibus omnium per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trectaiur.</note> 
                     <hi>that we ſee him, we touch him,</hi> though not in his owne shape and ſpecies. Whence is rightly concluded that we cannot diſcerne him, not that we cannot ſee him: which is maniſeſt by the example of a man wholy couered with a Lions skinne, whom indeede we should not diſcerne; marrie ſee him and touch him euery man might.</p>
                  <p>Now that the thing is changed in this kind of oblation: ſo far forth as is requiſite to profeſse and publish Gods ſupreame power, and that it is inſtituted to that end, is the thing I am to proue, which I will distinctly and planely verifie.</p>
                  <p>The mutation which is made in the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:21747:101"/>Euchariſt, conſiſts in this, that Chriſt who ſubſiſts in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>auen in his owne liuing forme is placed in earth, as a deade man, vnder the shape of bread and wine. That he is put vnder the ſpecies of bread and wine, is alreadie shewen; and that in that ſtate, he exiſtes vnder the ſpecies and liknes of a deade man, is euident, for that diuers wayes he is depriued of apparence of life, nor doth a man diſcouer any virall action in him: and also becauſe by the force and vertue of the ſacramentall words, his body and blood is put vnder ſeperated ſpecies; as by the death which he ſuffered on the Croſse, they were really ſeperated. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, becauſe the ſpecies vnder which he is vayled, are commeſtible, nor is it the cuſtome to eate flesh which is not deade.</p>
                  <p>And that this mutation doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare Gods ſoueraignetie ouer vs, I proue. The mutation which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by the true death of Chriſt, had ſuch prower, as is manifeſt by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the croſſe. Therfore, that mutation which is made in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt hath the ſame force; The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21747:102"/>is verified, becauſe all thoſe things are found in the Euchariſte, for which the mutation which happened in the ſacryfice of the croſſe, did pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the ſoueraigne authoritie which God hath ouer vs. I will indeuour to make it as plane and intelligible as the difficultie of the matter will permit.</p>
                  <p>It is certaine then that ſenſibilitie, and the nature or eſſence of a ſigne, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to accidents and ſpecies, not to ſubſtances; which of their owne nature are not ſubiect to ſenſe, that is, what ſoeuer doth ſignifie, ſignifies by the fauour and meanes of accidents. For example, a man is not knowen, but by ſpeach, motion, and other accidents. Now it is euident, that ſacraments and ſacryfices, are of their owne nature viſible ſignes; and that their eſsence conſiſts in ſignifying hidden miſteries ſenſibly to men. Wherfore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that it imports not, whether Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and ſacryfices, whoſe nature is to ſignifie, be placed in ſpecies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning to their ſubſtances, or els in ſpecies ſeperated from them; for wheras euery thing can ſubſiſte when it hath all
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:21747:102"/>that is eſſentiall to it, they will eaſily conſerue their beeing without the helpe of ſubſtances, which contribute nothing to their Eſſence. Whence it followes that death is no otherwiſe apte to ſignifie the ſupreame dominion of God, then in regard of its externall ſpecies, in ſo much as one diſcouers no accident teſtifynig life. Now Chriſt as he is in the Euchariſt, appeares to be deade, as he was vpon the Croſſe; and conſequently hath all that he had vpon the Croſſe, in point of a ſenſible ſigne, apte to make demonſtration of the ſoueraigntie of God, which is all that is required to a ſacryfice. For it is certaine, that as a liuing body in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearence, by the vertue of ſome cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractere, might be made capable to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie as much as a liuing body indeede, could ſignifie: ſo a liuing body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing deade, by the vertue of Chriſts words, may be a ſigne of all thoſe things, which a creature truly deade, were apt to repreſent.</p>
                  <p>And indeede it is a thing which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholikes nor you can doubt of. Not Catholikes, becauſe the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:21747:103"/>vnder the ſpecies of bread is no leſſe a Sacrament, then though the ſubſtance of breade were ioyned with its ſpecies.<note place="margin">Ioan. <hi>3.</hi> v. <hi>14.</hi>
                     </note> Not you, ſince that braſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecies of a ſerpent, was as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a ſigne of the death of Chriſt, as though the true ſubſtance of a ſerpent, had bene ioyned to the apparence of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now we muſt ſee whether this muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is apt in it ſelfe to teſtifie Gods ſoueraignetie, were a so inſtituted to that end.</p>
                  <p>Which is apparent, in that, to iudge that God hath determined a thing to ſome certaine end, it is ſufficient to proue that he endowed it with all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges neceſſarie to that end, it being an v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Ard verily if this manner of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the inſtitution of a thing to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me certaine end, be not ſufficient, we

They are truly in it, and a true ſacryfice is the Euchariſt, ſeeing it hath all the partes that are eſſentiall to a ſacrifice. What anſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ere I pray you will you retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne me to this? Will you reply, that if it be enough to put a creature, vnder the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parences and ſpecies of death, and ſo to offer it to God, to make a ſacryfice, the Picture of Ieſus-Chriſt offered vp to God would be a ſacryfice.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwere, that in ſuch an oblation, one could not affirme that there were any ſacrifice ether of Ieſus-Chriſt, or of his Picture. Not of Ieſus-Chriſt, becauſe he would ſo nether be effectually and truly dead nor yet in Apparence, wheras yet it is neceſſarily required that the thing ſignified be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, one of theſe two wayes. Not of his Picture, becauſe though it were preſent, yet should it not be diſtroyed, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21747:104"/>at all. Now it happens not ſo in the Euchariſt: for Ieſus Chriſt is preſent in it, and ſuffers death in apparence, for as much as he doth vayle himſelfe in a deade ſpecies, which he doth Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally vnite vnto himſelfe; euen as being the Word he clothed himſelfe with humane shape, which he did vnite vnto himſelfe hypoſtatically or perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. And theifore when we ſay, that it ſufficeth, to ſacryfice a liunig creature, that it be put vnder the ſpecies of death: our meaning is not, that it should be put ſo by way of repreſentation, as though it were purtraited deade: or els, (being repreſented liuing) as though it were contayned vnder the onely ſpecies of the deade picture; becauſe in euery ſacrifice the preſence of the thing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, becauſe the oblation of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryfice is accomplished by the deliuerie of that which is offered and ſacrificed. But our meaning is, that the liuing creature, should in it ſelfe, be couered with the ſpecies and appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of death, and ſo be offered to God. This reaſon doth <hi>(a priore)</hi> or demonſtratiuely shew, that the celebration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſte
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21747:105"/>is a true ſaciyfice: How beit the breuitie which I haue propoſed vnto my ſelfe, shall not hinder me to produce another reaſon therof.</p>

                  <p>You will peraduenture grant, that it is eſſentiall to preiſthood to ſacryfice, but not to ſacrifice at all tymes: wherfore, to iuſtile Chriſt a preiſt now, it is ſufficient that he could once ſacrynce, as he did
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21747:107"/>vpon the croſſe. I anſwere that if power to ſacryfice be eſſentiall to preiſthoode as I haue alreadie proued; it followes therupon, that it muſt aggtee to it at all tymes: ſeeing an eſſentiall compound cannot ſubſiſte but by the ſuſtance of all its eſſentiall partes. For example a man cannot ſubſiſte without the, <hi>ratio forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> formall cauſe of a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without both body and ſoule ioyned together. It remaynes therfore, that I. C. being at this preſent Preiſt, muſt haue power to offer another ſacrifice, then that of the croſſe, which also is manifeſt out of S.

                  <p>If no more then the fruite of a ſacryfice be required to the eternitie ef prieſthoode, it followes that the fruite of a ſacryfice is the eſſence of preifthoode: nay more, that nothing els is eſſentiall vnto it, which is moſt abſurde. In concluſion, this truih of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryfice, is taken ether for the vertue which the ſacrifice hath to iuſtifie, or for the effect of this verue which is our iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the firſt acception it is a qualitie of a ſacryfice: in the ſecond, it is an effect of this qualitie; and therfore howſoeuer you take it, of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of preiſthoode it cannot be, ſince it is the effect of the ſame, in ſo much as it is the effect of the ſacryfice, and that no effect can be the eſſence of its cauſe. It cannot be of the eſſence, becauſe what ſo euer is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to a thing, becomes the ſame thing with that of whoſe eſſence it is, which cannot be ſaid of the effect and the cauſe which are neceſſarily diſtinguished. Finally it cannot be of the eſſence, becauſe the cauſe doth preceede its effect, wheras a compound
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:21747:109"/>preceedes not its eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall partes. Preiſthood is not the vertue and force of the facrynce, but the vertue and force of facryficing. As for example Roya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tie is not the fruite and commoditie which we receaue by gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the power to gouerne. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſith I. C. inioyes preiſthood for euer, he hath alſo power to ſacryfice for euer, It being a thing moſt euident that the preiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode cannot be erernall, while the power of ſacryficing, which is eſſentiall vnto it, is temporall. Nor will it be to the purpoſe for you to ſay, that wheras Chriſt doth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually offer vp his payers to God for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he doth also continually offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for ſince the conditions neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the eſſence of a true ſacryfice, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuite with prayers, as we haue shewed out of the definition, the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of prayers, cannot be a true ſacryfice. And this is ſo cleare and manifeſt, that, when as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls Chriſt an <hi>eternall preiſt,</hi> it aſcribes that dignitie vnto him by reaſon of a true ſacryfice.

                  <p>You will happily ſay that Chriſt in his laſt ſupper communicated his Apoſtles, and conſequently that we are bound to imitate him by diſtributing the Euchariſt to the people. But this proues no more but that the people may communicate, that it is to be deſired that they would communicate, and that, when they will, it should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them: but it imports not, that we are bound to thruſt the Euchariſt vpon them againſt their will, and that we are not to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate, vnleſſe they communicate.

                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:21747:128"/>
                  <p>To what purpoſe did you taxe the two firſt Orders of State, accuſing the one of factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other of weaknes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to the kings Maieſtie, but to let the world ſee, that when you beare à ſplene againſt any one, wtih à wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full boldnes you faigne faults to diffame him, though withont all fundation: for none can beignorant, but that, if there were any faction, it gott entrie by their meanes, who out of tyme a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſeaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would needs moue à queſtion, wherof the Church, Nobilitie, and the greater part of the three ſtates ſtriue to ſtoppe the courſe; moued therto by diuers reaſons, which in à few wonds I will deduce.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being meerly ſpirituall, whether God had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> power to the Church to depoſe kings, in caſes of hereſie and in fidelitie, when they doe not onely make profeſſion of them; but doe alſo shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues perſequutours of the name of Chriſt a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the true faith: as alſo whether this power did aggree with the word of God, or no; finall whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were lawfull to vrge all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take an oath, wherby they should affirme that it was not according to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:21747:128"/>Gods word? which being handled in the aſſemblie: a body compoſed of lay-perſons, could not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in it without ſacriledge, without intrenching vpon the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others; mounting into Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his chaire; laying hand vpon the incenſoir, and conſequently, without expoſing themſelues to the deſaſters, which are wont to follow ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and ſacrilegious enterpriſes. Nay euen the Clergie it ſelfe, of a particular Church, as of the Church of France could not decide this point, ſince it belongs to the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church onely, to define Articles of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe all the kings and ſtates in Chriſtendome, hauing intereſt in this cauſe, one onely king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome could not iudge of it, without the appouall and authoritie of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe the holy Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interreſſed in this matter, your adherents who haue ſworne its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and who eſteeme the ruine therof their eſtablishment, could
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:21747:129"/>not be held impattiall iudges, though ſome of them indeuoured to deale in it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, becauſe out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition which you aymed at, there followed a moſt euident ſchiſme by eſtablishing an article of faith parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the Churches of France, not Catholike or common to the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, whence there followed a diuiſion in faith.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, becauſe the deciſion of this queſtion, was not onely of no effect to the health and ſecuritie of kings (which was yet the ſole end of the queſtion) but was euen preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vnto them, as may be ſeene by that which that great Cardinall and honour of his age, wrote vpon that ſubiect, who doth moſt amply handle this matter, with eloquence equall to the profunditie of learning, which all the world admires in him. Theſe reaſons being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſion, will leaue no doubt in any man but that the Clergie-men were worthy of praiſe not of blame, for refuſing to decide a queſtion,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21747:129"/>which was propoſed vnto them to a bad end; nor did the deciſion therof belong vnto them. And therfore it carries no colour, but is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to truth, to accuſe them of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, adding, that they, and a part of the nobilitie, made the king looſe his cauſe. For how doe you not blush for shame to affirme this, ſince it is notorious to the word, that in all the articles of the Clergie, and nobilitie, there was no propoſition made, much leſſe any determination, of any thing that tends in any the leaſt meaſure to the diminution of the ſoueraigne power of our kings, and the dignitie of their crowne: and that the article preſented by the aduiſe of ſome of the third order was onely reiected, without euer deliberating vpon the contents therof? it is a groſſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence to ſay that we cauſed the king to looſe a cauſe, where no iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was paſt and to make his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie a partie in a cauſe where he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpoſed himſelfe, by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to conſerue things in the ſame ſtate, in which they ſtoode. If
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:21747:130"/>any were caſt in their cauſe, it is you, who vnder pretext of maintayning the authoritie of kings, would haue brought inn a ſchiſme amongſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes.</p>
                  <p>As for the letters which the Pope wrote vpon this matter, if it be a fault in a father to write to his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to receaue their fathers letters, his holines is blame-worthy to haue done that honour to the two orders wherof we ſpeake, and they cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in receauing them: Marrie ſeeing common ſenſe doth teach vs that there is nothing in all this which is not moſt conuenient, you wrong vs in vpbrading vs with it, and in ſtriuing to bring our holy Father into hatred, as though forſooth, by vertue of that letter, he would haue made ſome aduantage ouer this ſtate, which is altogether ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>Your ſtrife in this, is, to make the Popes power be ſuſpected by all the kings of the earth: But regall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie, and the dignitie of the Church haue noe repugnancie, the duties which we render to the holy Sea doe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:21747:130"/>no wayes hinder vs to make appeare by effects what you profeſſe in words: to wit, that a ſubiect owes his life and all his fortunes to the defence of the dignitie of his king's crowne. In this, you shall continually haue vs not for companions onely, but euen for Guides. And doubtleſſe if you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond vs, as I beſeech God grant, and giue credit vnto vs, France shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue her peace which hitherto hath bene too much troubled by yours.</p>
                  <p>But with what face can you affirme that the Pope hath the thirds of the the territories of France; that he hath ſeduced the fift part of the knigs ſubiects from their obedience to him? and that out of the kingdome we haue another ſoueraigne in pointe of temporalities?</p>
                  <p>It is falſe that the Pope hath the third part of France, ſeeing he hath onely the Countie of Amgnion, which his Predeceſſours bought of the Counts of that Prouince. It is falſe that he withdrew the Clergie from their obedience to their king: ſith they preach obedience vnto
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:21747:131"/>and will preach it all the dayes of their life, in word, and worke. It is falſe that we doe not eſteeme our ſelues the kings ſubiects: ſithens in ſubiection to him we are readie to ſpend our liues for his ſeruice. It is falſe that we did not ſubmitt our ſelues to temporall iuriſdiction, as though, to pretend exemptions in certaine caſes, by the conceſſion and grant of our Princes, whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is in queſtion, were to franchiſe our ſelues from their iuriſdiction; and to inioy a benefit (granted by a king) in vertue of his Grant, were not rather an accnowledgment of his authoritie then a withdrawing from it. It is falſe that we accnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any other ſoueraigne in our temporalls, then our king.</p>
                  <p>It is falſe that the Pope pretends to haue authoritie to put kings to death. Falſe that he practiſed this pretended power: falſe that he holds this kingdome to be a fief which holds on, and owes homage to his chaire falſe to conclud, that the king liues but at his diſcretion.</p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:21747:131"/>
                  <p>Kings would be immortall, if their conſeruation depended vpon Popes, who wish their good, as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents the good of their children. Vvhy did he who to the great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of all Chriſten dome, ſits now in the chaire of Peter,<note place="margin">The cenſure of Ianuarie <hi>1613.</hi>

Vvhy did he approue that the Clergie of France in the aſſemblie of the ſtates, and that Sorbone at other tymes, did renew the publication of the article of the Councell of Conſtance, which pronunceth a curſe vpon thoſe that doe attempt vpon kings, vnleſſe their liues were as deare to him as his owne?</p>
                  <p>You paſſe ouer theſe truthes in obliuion, and not without reaſon, ſeeing they diſcouer to all men, that it is falſe to affirme, that the Popes, and Clergie of France, doe not affect the kings proſperitie; they doe, and will alwayes doe in ſuch a meaſure, that the Pope will not omitt to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:21747:132"/>indeuour any thinge which may tend to their good; nor will the Clergie-men of France euer ſpare their owne liues, to aſſure the life of their ſaueraigne. If accuſations were enough to make a man cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, none would be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faulte: innocencie would not be exempt. You are bold in laying aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but that which is your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, is, that you fall short in your proofes. You make vs criminall in point of our dutie towards our France, while to you she ſtands bound for benefits: as though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, her defence were onely found in your hands: and your weapons were her warrant againſt the vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of ſtrangers. You doe wiſely to tearme them ſtrangers, leaſt your owne enterpriſes might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, which are ſo frequent and palpable that the weakeſt witt will with facilitie deſerne, that it is not your affection to your king which makes you ſo zealous of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes but your hatred to the Pope, and the vniuerſall Church.</p>

                  <p>And that it may not ſeeme that I impoſe vpon you, I will make clearly appeare, that you grant a far greater power to the people, then that which you deny the Pope, which is exceedingly diſaduantagious to kings: for there is no man that doth not eſteement a thing far more peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, to be expoſed to the diſcretion of the rude multitude, which doth eaſily, though falſly, eſteeme it ſelfe oppreſſed, and which is a many headed Hyder which is ordinarily gouerned by its owne paſſions, then to be ſubiect to the correction, of a tender Father, whoſe hart is full of affection, for his childrens aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>

                  <p>GOd's goodnes is ſo greate that ordinarily he doth conuert, the euil which is intended againſt his friends, to their benefit. Your ayme is to hurt the Ieſuites, and you doe them great ſeruice: ſince all men will confeſſe that it is a great glorie vnto them, to be blamed with the ſame mouth, which doth accuſe the Catholike Church; reiects good workes; calumniates the ſaintes; iniures Ieſus Chriſt; yea makes euen God himſelfe blame-worthy. It is a thing truly whichmakes greatly to their aduantage, we ſee it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: for ſo much as, beſides the conſiderations which ought to make all men eſteeme them, diuers doe loue them particularly, becauſe you hate them.</p>

For he that is eſtablished on earth, to ſee that God be ſerued, ought exactly to know the rule of Gods ſeruice: he who in his charge repreſents God's royaltie, ought in his actions to imitate his iuſtice: which how can it be done without knowing the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne rule of Iuſtice, which is the word of God? Vvher vpon it is that God commands kings continually to haue before their eyes the booke of the law, therin to read all the dayes of their life. But if they permitt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be hood winked, and be content to follow without ſeeing the way before them, the Popes and Prelates haue faire occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to accommodate religion to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate lucre, and crect their owne greatnes, vpon the ruines of the Ghoſpell.

                  <p>The Prelates, nether intrench vpon the liuing nor the deade, but doe greatly aſſiſte the one and the other, wheras you abuſe them both.

                  <p>You ſay that the Pope for ſome ages paſt, hath hindred kings to read the Scriptures. Where doe you find that prohibition? The Popes would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes exceedingly reioyce, that

They will alſo ſee that the Pope makes not himſelfe the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame iudge of faith, but that he was conſtituted ſuch by God and the Church which is the pillar and rocke of truth, ſeeing God did conſtitute Peter <hi>a Petra</hi> or rocke vpon which it is built.</p>
                  <p>And indeede S.

                  <p>It is true indeede, as the Fathers doe obſerue, that temporall felicitie doth follow religion, marrie not yours, but that onely which was left vs by the Apoſtles, and which to this day is conſerued in the Romane Church.

               <p>Hence it is apparent that you teach in expreſſe tearmes, that the lawes of men, doe in no ſort oblige conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces; which is à doctrine deteſted by the Catholike Church, and ought to be ſo, by all the world: ſithens it layes open à broad gate to diſobedience, ther being no more efficacious meanes to teach the contempt of the authoritie, of the Church, Kings, and Magiſtrates, and to violate their lawes and ordonnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then by openly perſuading all men that none of them oblige in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Now there remaynes nothing, but that I earneſtly beſeech you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into your owne harts, to diſpoſe your ſelues to enter into the way of ſaluation. What, will you remayne in à religion, which braging of much, can proue nothing? who knowes not that it is now 1600. Yeares ſince Ieſus-Chr.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:21747:183"/>eſtablished his Church, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe of perpetuitie: how can that then which was but hatched within the tearme of 100. yeares, be his? who ſees not, that, the names CATHOLIKE and CHRISTIAN, being the Church her proper names, the religion to which they belong not, and to which the qualities which they ſignifie, cannot agree, cannot iuſtly boaſt that it hath the true Church? Who ſees not that à Religion which manifeſtly contradictes the Scripture, in many principall points of its beleife, is not that which was left vs by Ieſus-Chriſt, and his Apoſtles? Who ſees not that they who vnder pretext of Gods honour, iniure him; who in words pretend holy Scripture, and in in deedes foiſt in place of it, that of men; and rely vpon it as the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their faith; who ſees not, I ſay, that thoſe men carrie not the torch which we are to follow? Who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he who denyes the greateſt part of the miſteries, becauſe they are burdenſome vnto him, who forſakes them to follow his owne wayes and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:21747:183"/>fancie, who will haue no viſible Heade of the Church, that they may liue free from obedience vnto him; who to exempt himſelfe from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and painſtaking, will not haue the blood of Ieſus-Chriſt, to render our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s purgatiue, propitiatorie, or merirorious: who, in à word, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all paine, to paſſe to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in à fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bed: who, I ſay, will beleeue, that ſuch an one is in the way of ſaluation, nay who doth not ſee, that he runs the ſtraight way to his Erernall perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>Is any ſo ſilly as not to diſcouer that they who promis the people full and intire libertie to uſe the Scripture, and yet giue them no other, but to looke upon the letters, and receaue into their eares the ſounds of words: and who put the Bible into their hands, as the way of ſaluation, which yet they accnowledge not to be authenticall, yea depraued, and corrupt, are but meere mockers, and impoſtures in things of importance towards ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Who will not planely ſee, that à man hath no aſſurance in à religion,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:21747:184"/>wherin all the aſſurance of ſaluation depends vpon the warranty of mens opinions, and of each one, in his owne cauſe; in à religion the authours wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of die deſperate. Shall one follow thoſe who profeſſe punctually to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Ieſus-Chriſt, yet doe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to that which he did in that moſt ſacred miſterie which he inſtituted before his death? Shall one iudge that à true religion which banisheth all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryfice, without which neuer yet reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was?</p>
               <p>Who will not iudge that the true way not to follow the ſaints, is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their enemyes, and ſuch as vomit out à thouſand blaſphemies againſt their honour, and puritie. Will any deeme it the readie way to Chriſt, to loade him with blaſphemies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies iſſuing out of à ſacrilegious mouth? And will not euen blind men ſee, that to make God authour of ſinne and man's perdition, is to perish in ones iudgment, and to adiudge ones ſelfe to eternall flames? And verily, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Father's iudgment, he is lyable to à more greeuious cryme,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:21747:184"/>who diuides the miſticall body of Chriſt, then though he should teare in peeces, his true body. Who then will not hold your religion abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which ſtands conuicted of ſo great, and deteſtable à ſchiſme? And who is he that will not condemne it, when he obſerues it to be patched out of the horred heapes of old hereſies, and conſequently condemned by it owne iudgment, ſince it is condemned by the primitiue Church, which it doth accnowledge to be the true Church? Can à louer of vertue and hater of vice follow that ſocietie, which shuts vp all paſſages to vertue? And will he not planely diſcerne, that to lay open the way to all vice, is no other thing then to lay open the broad way to Hell. In fine, who ſees not, that that ſocietie, which will ſubmitt it-ſelfe to no lawes, ſpirituall or ciuile, cannot be ſubiect to the lawes of God?</p>
               <p>They are worſe then blind men that cannot diſcouer this light. Let euery one open his eyes, and beware of being misledd by the como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> errour of many, to witt, that the deſire they haue to be
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:21747:185"/>ſaued, puts them in aſſurance, where euer they be. They may pleaſe to know, that if our deſire were ſufficient to iuſtifie vs, then they that thought they did ſeruice and ſacryfice vnto God, in putting to death the Apoſtles, wrought their owne ſaluation, and not the damnation of their ſoules. Let them know, that though one haue an intention to goe to Rome; and yet holde on the way to Geneua, they shall neuer arriue at Rome. Let them learne of the Fathers, that there is no ſaluation out of the Church; none is aſſured againſt the wroth of God, who is not sheltered vnder that couert. Let not the ſimple deceaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by thinking that their Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would not haue the face to preach with ſuch aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, what they were not aſſured of: becauſe if it were enough for heretikes for the approbation of their doctrine, to publish it as good, and all contrarie to it, as worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, one could not accuſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie of the greateſt Hereſiarkes that euer liued, for with the pretended
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:21747:185"/>aſſurance of truth, they defended their blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>I know indeede that the conuerſion of à ſoule is à difficult thing. I know that as an impoyſoned hart, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port goes, cannot be conſumed by fire: ſo God, who is à conſuming fire, doth hardly inflame harts infected with the poyſon of errour, by reaſon of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles which he finds therin. Yet can he, and will he doe it, if euery one put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his paſſion, put on à fitt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and imbrace the meanes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the holy Fathers. <hi>If thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt,</hi> ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. de vtilit. credendi c. <hi>8.</hi> Si iam tibi ſatis iactatus Sideris, finemque huiuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi laboribus vis imponere ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere viam Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicae diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae, quae ab ipſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
